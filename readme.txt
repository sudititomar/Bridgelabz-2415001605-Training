This repository contains all the college assignments and practice projects given as part of the Bridgelabz training program. 
It is organized based on the syllabus topics and assignment names rather than by weeks.
Each folder corresponds to a specific assignment or syllabus module, containing source code, solutions, and related files. 
The repository serves as a personal record of my progress while working through practical coding tasks assigned by the Bridgelabz
instructors, helping me apply theoretical concepts in real coding scenarios.
